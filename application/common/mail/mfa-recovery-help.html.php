<p>Dear <?= yHtml::encode($displayName) ?>,</p>

<p>
    You have requested assistance in accessing your <?= yHtml::encode($idpDisplayName) ?> Identity account. An email
    containing an access code has been sent to your recovery contact at <?= yHtml::encode($recoveryEmail) ?>.
    This access code can be used in place of your other 2-Step Verification options. Please contact
    your recovery contact to obtain this access code from them.
</p>
<p>
    If you did not request this code, it could be a sign someone else has compromised your account. Please
    contact <?= yHtml::encode($supportName) ?> at <?= yHtml::encode($supportEmail) ?>
    as soon as possible to report the incident.
</p>
<p>
    Thanks,
</p>
<p>
