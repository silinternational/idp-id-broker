Feature: User
  In order to identify users
  As an authorized requester
  I need to be able to manage user information

  Background:
    Given the user store is empty

  Scenario: Create a new user
    Given a record does not exist with an employee_id of "f6bf51f2-4ccc-4d85-8f75-02132c67af27"
      And the requester is authorized
      And I provide the following valid data:
        | property        | value                               |
        | employee_id     | f6bf51f2-4ccc-4d85-8f75-02132c67af27|
        | first_name      | Shep                                |
        | last_name       | Clark                               |
        | display_name    | Shep Clark                          |
        | username        | shep_clark                          |
        | email           | shep_clark@example.org              |

        | hide            | yes                                 |
    When I request "/user" be created
    Then the response status code should be 200
      And the following data is returned:
        | property        | value                               |

        | profile_review  | no                                  |
      And the uuid property should be a valid UUID
      And the following data is not returned:
        | property                |
        | current_password_id     |

      And a record exists with an employee_id of "f6bf51f2-4ccc-4d85-8f75-02132c67af27"

  Scenario Outline: Attempt to act upon a user as an unauthorized user

  Scenario: Retrieve a single user
    Given the requester is authorized
      And the user store is empty
      And I provide the following valid data:
        | property         | value                     |
        |   employee_id    |   123                     |

        |   email          |   john_connor@example.org |
        |   personal_email |   john_connor@example.com |
        |   manager_email  |   kyle_reese@example.org  |
        |   groups         |   it                      |
      And I request "/user" be created
    When I request "/user/123" be retrieved
    Then the response status code should be 200
      And the following data is returned:
        | property         | value                     |
        |   employee_id    |   123                     |
        |   employee_id    |   123                     |

        |   method.add     |   no                      |
      And the following data is not returned:
        | property                  |
        |   current_password_id     |
        |   password_expires_at_utc |
      And the response should contain a member array with only these elements:
        | element              |
        |   it                 |
        |   {idpName}          |
      And the uuid property should be a valid UUID

  Scenario: Fetch a user with no primary email address after user's expiration date
    Given a record does not exist with an employee_id of "123"
      And the requester is authorized
      And I provide the following valid data:
        | property        | value                 |
        | employee_id     | 123                   |
        | first_name      | New                   |
        | last_name       | Guy                   |
        | username        | new_guy               |
        | personal_email  | personal@example.com  |
      And I request "/user" be created
      And I wait until after the user new_guy expiration date
    When I request "/user/123" be retrieved
    Then the response status code should be 200
      And the following data is returned:
        | property         | value                     |
        |   employee_id    |   123                     |
        |   username       |   new_guy                 |
        |   email          |   personal@example.com    |
        |   personal_email |   personal@example.com    |
        |   active         |   no                      |
        |   locked         |   no                      |
      And a record exists with an employee_id of "123"
      And the following data should be stored:
        | property            | value              |
        | username            | new_guy            |
        | active              | no                 |
        | locked              | no                 |

  Scenario Outline: HR notification users
    Given I create a new user with a "active" property of "<active>"
      And the user has not logged in for "<loginTime>"
    When I get users for HR notification
    Then the user <isOrIsNot> included in the data

    Examples:
      | active | loginTime | isOrIsNot |
      | no     | 5 months  | is NOT    |
      | no     | 7 months  | is NOT    |
      | yes    | 5 months  | is NOT    |
      | yes    | 7 months  | is        |
